    <p class="summary">One Hack for a healthy lifestyle is to take just 10 to 20 minutes to rearrange your pantry, fridge and countertop today. Another hack is to go straight from your bed to the streets or your mat. Run a mile as fast as you can, do a 10-minute plyometric routine or work through a tough Tabata. One last hack is if you do one thing to move more this month, make it sitting less. Adding lots of spices (think turmeric, cinnamon, cayenne, ginger and rosemary) can enhance the flavor of your food, while also providing anti-inflammatory benefits and antioxidants, so add a little kick to your smoothie, stir fry, eggs, or salad dressings. These zero-calorie palate pleasers might even help you cut back on sugar and salt. You can take a friend to yoga, or to go for a run with you, or hit up your fittest friend for a strength training session. Having a few people who are on board with your month of commitment means you're less likely to bail out of a class.</p>
