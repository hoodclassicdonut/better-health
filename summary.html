    <p class="summary">When you think about doing a healthy lifestyle overhaul simultaneously cleaning up your diet, exercising more and stressing less it's enough to send you running right back to bed. That's why it's always better to start with small, manageable changes that can easily fit into your day. One Hack for a healthy lifestyle is to take just 10 to 20 minutes to rearrange your pantry, fridge and countertop today. Another hack is to go straight from your bed to the streets or your mat. Run a mile as fast as you can, do a 10-minute plyometric routine or work through a tough Tabata. Whatever you choose, put in some real effort and youâ€™ll get more healthier. One last hack is if you do one thing to move more this month, make it sitting less. Studies link staying in your seat to a higher risk of premature death even if you exercise on the regular, so start by taking one of your calls outside and around the block or catching up with a co-worker as you stroll to grab a cup of coffee.</p>
