                    <li>One of the problems of eating unhealthy food is that it gives weight problems to children and that causes an addiction. Over time, it can result in several chronic health problems, asthma, cystic fibrosis, congenital heart disease, diabetes</li>
                    <li>Most children nowadays are not getting enough exercises and the results are unbelievable. Children spend most of their time on their smartphones, playing games, watching TV or searching in a web browser.</li>
                    <li>For most children today, their diet is made up of  fast foods and junk food. They are constantly eating burgers, pizzas, sweets and carbonated drinks. The nutrition is removed and what  is needed for the child for a good diet is homemade foods, vegetables and fruits.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Family meals are a comforting ritual for both parents and kids. Children like the predictability of family meals and parents get a chance to catch up with their kids. Kids who take part in regular family meals are also:</li>
                    <li>less likely to snack on unhealthy foods</li>
                    <li>less likely to smoke, use marijuana, or drink alcohol</li>
                    <li>Stock Up on Healthy Foods</li>
                    <li>Kids, especially younger ones, will eat mostly what's available at home. That's why it's important to control the supply lines â€” the foods that you serve for meals and have on hand for snacks.</li>

                    <li>'SEHHI on Health Menus', this makes identifying menu items with low fat, sugar, salt, and high fiber contents easier by placing the SEHHI logo on them</li>
                    <li>'Displaying Calories on the Menu', which obliges the inclusion of the calorie count of food menu items</li>
                    <li>'SEHHI for Healthy Groceries and Supermarkets', this programme encourages the promotion of healthy food and ingredients across supermarkets and grocery stores.</li>
