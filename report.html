    <p class="summary">Because the school canteen has recently been selling unhealthy food, our head teacher, Ms. Pamela, has asked us to write a report about the advantages of having healthy food in the canteen. Additionally, we were asked to include ways of promoting it.</p>
    <h1 class="findings"><u>Findings: </u></h1>
    <p class="summary">Although eating unhealthy food may taste better than healthy food, it can many serious long term and short term negative effects. However, eating healthy food has many advantages. For example, students who have a healthy lunch are known to be better learners and perform better academically. This is because they are well nourished and receive all the vitamins and carbohydrates needed to fuel them for the rest of the school day. Not only does eating nutrient-rich, healthy foods prevent sudden mood swings and depression, but it can also prevent you from having an upset stomach, which will decrease the chances of students getting distracted during their school lessons.</p>
    <h1 class="conclusion"><u>Conclusion: </u></h1>
    <p class="summary">Ultimately, healthy food is more beneficial than unhealthy food for students. I suggest increasing the price of unhealthy food to promote additions of healthy food in the canteen, and adding a wide selection of healthy than unhealthy food.</p>
